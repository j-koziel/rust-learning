pub fn main() {
    // Two data subsets
    // scalar and compound

    // Since rust is a statically typed language it is a must to annotate each variable with a data type -> reliability

    /////////////////////////////////
    // Scalar types
    // These are types which represent a single value.
    // integers, floating-points, booleans and chars

    // Integer types
    // A number without a fractional component -> basically no decimals
    // There are unsigned and signed
    // Signed refers to integers which are negative and require a "sign"
    // Unsigned is when we are sure that the number can only ever be positive and does not require a "sign"

    // Limits of unsigned and signed integers
    // n is the number of bits
    // unsigned: 0 to (2^n) - 1

    // signed: -(2^n-1) -> 2^n-1 - 1
